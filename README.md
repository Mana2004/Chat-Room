# Just a Simple TCP Chat Room

This project is a simple TCP-based multi-client chat application that allows users to send and receive public and private messages. 
The chat room supports real-time communication between clients connected to a central server. 
It includes features like username management, public messaging, private one-on-one chats, and a user list for easy interaction. 
The application uses sockets to establish connections and communicate between clients and the server. 
The GUI is built using Tkinter, providing a user-friendly interface that integrates seamlessly with the core chat functionality written in Python.
